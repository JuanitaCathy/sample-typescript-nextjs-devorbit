Welcome to DevOrbit, the ultimate space for devs to pair program, share code snippets, and work together. Whether you're looking to work on a project, brainstorm new ideas, or just have a random chat about your favorite tech topics, DevOrbit has got you covered. It's where magic happens—think of it as your coding spaceship?
The idea behind DevOrbit was to create a space where developers from around the globe can connect and collaborate based on their interests. I find myself to be very efficient when I code alongside some hardworking folks on my idea, it keeps me going and sometimes even give rise to new ideas during chat. So yes, that is kinda the idea behind DevOrbit.
